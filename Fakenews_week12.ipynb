        "1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a powerful tool in modern data science, enabling industries to analyze large volumes of data and make intelligent decisions. One of the major challenges in today’s digital world is the rapid spread of fake news through social media platforms, news websites, and messaging applications. Fake news can mislead people, influence public opinion, and cause serious social, political, and economic consequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of my project, Fake News Detection, is to automatically identify whether a news article is real or fake using data science and AI techniques. This project has strong real‑world relevance and can be applied across multiple industries such as media, healthcare, finance, and government.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Industry Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fake News in the Real World\n",
        "Fake news is not limited to entertainment or social media rumors. It directly impacts critical industries:\n",
        "\n",

        "Healthcare Industry\n",
        "\n",
        "According to WHO, misinformation during health crises (such as COVID‑19) can lead to harmful decisions, vaccine hesitancy, and panic. Fake medical advice can risk human lives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finance Industry\n",
        "\n",
        "Fake financial news can manipulate stock prices, cause market instability, and mislead investors. Even a single false headline can result in huge financial losses.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How My Project Solves This Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "My Fake News Detection project uses AI models to automatically analyze news text and classify it as REAL or FAKE.\n",

        "\n",
        "This automated pipeline can process large volumes of news articles much faster than manual fact‑checking.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Real‑World Industry Applications\n",
        "\n",
        "📰 Media & Journalism\n",
        "News agencies can integrate this model into their content management systems. Before publishing an article, the system can flag suspicious content for manual review, reducing the spread of misinformation.\n",
        "\n",
        "🏥 Healthcare Sector\n",
        "Hospitals, health organizations, and government bodies can use fake news detection systems to filter misleading health‑related articles and social media posts, ensuring only verified information reaches the public.\n",
        "\n",
        "💰 Finance & Stock Markets\n",
        "Financial institutions can apply this model to detect fake financial news and rumors that may affect market behavior. This helps protect investors and stabilize markets.\n",
        "\n",
        "🏛 Government & Policy Making\n",
        "Governments can use AI‑based fake news detection to monitor misinformation campaigns, especially during elections or national emergencies.\n",
