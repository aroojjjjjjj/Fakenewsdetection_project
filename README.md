# Fakenewsdetection_project
This repository contains weekly assignments for my Data Science course project.  
The project is assigned based on roll number, and my task is **Fake News Detection**.

ðŸ“… Weekly Progress

 âœ… Week 1: Orientation & Setup
- Installed Python (Google Colab used).  
- Created GitHub repository for project.  
- Downloaded sample dataset (Titanic/Iris) and displayed first 10 rows.  

âœ… Week 2: Data Collection & Cleaning
- Collected Fake News dataset.  
- Performed data cleaning:
  - Removed rows with missing values.  
  - Verified dataset contains no duplicates.  
- Saved and uploaded cleaned dataset to GitHub.  

 âœ… Week 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Created 5 different visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn:
  1. News Articles per Category (bar chart)  
  2. Fake vs Real News Distribution (bar chart)  
  3. Distribution of Article Lengths (histogram)  
  4. Article Length vs Category (scatter plot)  
  5. Top 10 Authors by Articles (bar chart)  
- Added short insights under each plot.

âœ… Week 4: Statistics & Probability
-Calculated mean, median, mode, and variance of dataset features.
-Performed correlation analysis between numeric features and target variable (label).
-Found the 3 most related features to the target:
1.text_length
2.title_length
3.One categorical feature (weak relation but considered).


 ðŸ“Œ Project Milestones So Far
- Environment setup complete.  
- Dataset collected and cleaned.  
- Initial exploratory data analysis completed.  
- Identified the key predictive variables most related to the target variable (label).
